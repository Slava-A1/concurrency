All development was done on the UT CS lab machines so no additional set up should be required to run this code. Just in case, I have decided to list out the g++ and Boost versions on my lab machine in case any issues arise.

- g++ version: 9.4.0
- Boost version: 1.71

The lab machines should have everything that boost needs and the program options library should be compiled already. If it is not, it may require manual compilation as per the instructions in Boost's documentation.
